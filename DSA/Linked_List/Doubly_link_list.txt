Doubly linked list 

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains data and two pointers: one pointing to the next node and the other pointing to the previous node. This allows traversal of the list in both forward and backward directions.

Insertion : 

Their are three type of Insertion in the doubly linked list

1) Insertion at the starting 
2) Insertion at the end 
3) Insertion at any position 

==> Insertion at the starting : In this we made we insert a node at the starting of the linked list 

Approach : 

Suppose : 
class node 
{
    public : 
      int data ; 
      node*pre ; 
      node*next ; 
    node (int val)
    {
        data = val ; 
        next=Null ; 
        pre=Null ;
    }
};

i) First of create a temp variable of node type 
ii) save the address of head ptr in the next of temp 
iii) save the address of temp into the  head->pre 
iv) Now insert the address of temp into the head
