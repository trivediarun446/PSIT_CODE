            A tree has atmost n degree node (0 ,1,2,3,4....n). That tree is know as n - arry tree . 


                                         Strict n-arry tree 

            A tree has 0 child or n child . this tree is called strict n-arry tree 


# Analysis of n-arry tree 


=> Suppose if have given Height of tree h . then we have to find the min number of node or max number of node 


                Formula for find min number of node :-
                                          
                            Node = nh+1 
                        where :- 
                              Node = min number of node 
                              n = type of tree ( 1 , 2 ,3 ....n)
                              h = Height  (given)   
                
                Formula for find max number of node :- 

                        let Height of tree is h and start traversing the tree level by level 
                    
                         level = 0 ,1 ,2,3,4,5.......h 

                        * it is a n-arry tree then we have max child is n in the each parent so we take this :- 

                        ==> Level wise node 
                            > level 0 = 1 (root node)
                            > level 1 = n 
                            > level 2 = n^(2) 
                            > level 3 = n^(3)
                                .
                                .
                                .
                                .
                                .
                            > level h = n^(h)
                        This seems like a gp so we use gp formula and our max node in n-arry tree is :- n^(h+1) - 1 / n - 1 

=> Suppose if we have given node of tree Node . then we have to find the min height of tree or max height of tree 


                Formula for find min height of tree :-
                                          
                            height = (Node - 1) / n
                        where :- 
                              Node = number of node in tree (given )
                              n = type of tree ( 1 , 2 ,3 ....n)
                              h = minimum height of tree     
                
                Formula for find max height of tree :-
                                          
                             height = logn(Node(m-1) + 1) - 1 
                        where :- 
                              Node = number of node in tree (given )
                              n = type of tree ( 1 , 2 ,3 ....n)
                              h = maximum height of tree     
                
==> Relation between internal node and External node 

                          e = ni + 1
                            or 
                          deg(0) = ndeg(n) + 1  
                        where:- 
                           e = External node 
                           i = internal node 
                           n = n-arry tree
