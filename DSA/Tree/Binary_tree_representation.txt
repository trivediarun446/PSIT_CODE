See how the binary tree is made :- 

===>>       (" Visit a image binary_tree.jpg " )

For Representation of binary tree in the Array we have to traverse the tree level by level . If we traverse the tree level by level
and save the data of tree into the array it seems like this 

    data :-         A   B   C   D   E   F   G 
    Index:-         0   1   2   3   4   5   6 



=> Now create a table to understand the Relation :- 
   
    Element           Index           Left-child         Right-child

      A                 0                 1                   2
      B                 1                 3                   4
      C                 2                 5                   7 

===> Observation from the table :- 
                                We any Element is stored at Index i then the left and right child of that Element is stored at Index
                                2*i + 1 and 2*i+2 respectively 
                    
                
            Formula :- 
                    Element : i 
                    Left-child: 2*i+1 
                    Right-child: 2*i+2
                    parent:- i+1/2

#                   Full Binary Tree :- 

Agar binary tree ki height ke according us tree mein maximum number of nodes hoge to vo full binary tree kahalata hai 

 if(number of nodes == 2^(h+1)-1){ cout<<"It is a full binary treee"<< endl}



#                   Complete Binary Tree :- 

Agar hm kisi binary tree ko level wise traverse kar ke array mein store karege 0
