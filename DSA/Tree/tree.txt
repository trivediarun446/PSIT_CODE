This file contain the notes of tree data structure 


# TREE : Tree is a hierarchical structure which store and oragnise the data in the parent and child relation .It is made of nodes and edages . 


# Important Terminology :- 

1) Root :- Root is first node of any tree 

2) parent :- If any node have  more then 1 child is called parent node 

3) child :- A child node is a node which is descendant of another node 

4) sibling :- nodes of a same parent is called sibling node 

5) Ancestors :- All node in the path of root node to that node are called Ancestors 

6) Degreee Of node :- Number of child of any node are called Degree of that node 

7) Levels :- the number of edges between that node and the root node and Levels start from the 1 to n . 
             if n number of edges prasent in a node then the Level of tree is n 

8) Height :- The Number of edages between the root node and last leaf node . Height is start from 0 
             If the leaf node at the position of n in any tree then the Height is n-1 

9) Forest :- Collections of tree is called Forest .

10) Internal Node :- Those nodes has 1 or more than 1 degree that nodes are called internal nodes 

11) External Node :- Those nodes has 0 degree are called External nodes these nodes are also called leaf nodes 



# Types of Tree 

1) Binary Tree 

2) Ternary Tree 

3) N-ary Tree 


# SOME BASIC TERM 

1) Left Skewed :- A  tree that has only left nodes or no right nodes then the tree is called Left Skewed tree 

2) Right Skewed :- A tree that has only right nodes or no left nodes then that tree is called Right Skewed Tree 

3) Labal Tree :- There is some value in the nodes of tree that tree called Labaled tree 

4) unlabel Tree :- There is no value in the nodes of tree that tree is called unlabel tree 





#                 Tree Traversals :- 


Preorder :- Visit root node -> Left node -> right node

Inorder :- Visit left node -> Root node -> right node 

Postorder :- Visit left node -> right node -> root node

Level order :- start visit from 0 level and go till the last leval
