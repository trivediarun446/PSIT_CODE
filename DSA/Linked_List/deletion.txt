In this we learn how to delete the node 

--> starting 
--> end 
--> at any point 

Delete node at starting index 

--> Approach 

1) first of all create  a tempory node which is pointing towards the starting node of linked list 
2) Then insert the address of second node into the head pointer 
3) In last using delete function to delete the current first node 

code snipet :- 

class node {
    public : 
       int data ; 
       node *next ; 
       node(int val) {
           data = val ; 
           next = Null ;
       }
};
int main ()
{
    node *temp ; 
    temp = head ; 
    head = head->next ; 
    delete temp ; 
}

Delete node from the last 

--> Approach 

check edage cases :-

1) check that link list is created or not 
2) check only one node is present in the linked list 
3) check that link list is creater than the one node
