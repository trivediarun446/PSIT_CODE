In Python file handling provide different methods to read , write and manuplate the data 
store in the file in a very efficient manner . In Python Provide many inbuilt function to to do these operation efficiently 



1) Opening of File 


   Using open() function we open the file 

   syntex : 
            file = open("filename" , "mode") 

    
    Mode :- Python provide different modes to open a file 
            some modes are written below 

        i) r = read mode we open the file into the reat mode 

        ii) w = write mode we open the file into the write mode 

        iii) a = append mode we open the file into the append mode in this mode we add text in the last line of the file 

        iv) r+ = This is read + write mode 

        v) w+ = this is write + read mode 

        vi) a+ = this is read + append mode 

        vii) rb = this mode is for binary file . using this mode we open the binary file into read mode 

        viii) wb = this mode is also for binary file . using this mode we open the binary file into the write mode
