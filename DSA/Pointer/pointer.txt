Main memory can be devide into the three part 1 st one is code part second one is stack and third one is heap 

In stack and code part of main memory is used for the accessing Program 

Heap is a external memory . Program can not access it directly . For heap memory we use pointer

pointer are used for accessing external resoureces 

pointer are also use for the parameter passing 

* for allocating space in heap memory we use calloc function in c 
pointing variable = (int*)calloc(nun.of element * sizeof(data_type))

*for allocation space in haap memory we use new functioni in c++
pointer variable = new int(5);
