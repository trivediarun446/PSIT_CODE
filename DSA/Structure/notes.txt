structure :- It is the collection of data members . structure is used as a user define data type . structure can be define by using struct data type , the size of structure is depend upon the total varible declared in the structure .  

declaration of structure :- 
              struct <name> {
               int a ; 
               string="arun" ;
               float b = 54.6 ; 

              };
 >>> this structure contain :- bits(int)+ bits(float), bits(string);


 when we declare the structure in main function then the memmory is allocate in the stack  memory of the main memory 


 --> we use dot operator for accessing the members 

 we can declare the struct variable globally 

method 1 : 
 
struct rectangle {
 int lenght ; int breath ; 
};
struct rectangle r1 ;   "here the variable is declare globally "
int main ()
{

}




method 2 : 

struct rectangle {
    int lenght ; int breath ; 

}r1; 

int main ()
{

}



method 3: "for multiple variable " 
struct rectangle {
    int lenght ; int breath ; 

}r1 , r2 ,r3,r4 ; 
"as per the requirent we can declare n number of varibale globally
int main ()
{
    
}
