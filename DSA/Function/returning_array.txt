1) before ruturing array from the function we use this [] . Using this comipler can automatically understand that it is an array .

2) we can also use * instead of [] . * is representing the pointer  and we know that pointer may pointing towards the element or may be array .

3) Some comipler are not able to understand the [] this so we can use * this also 

code snippet :- 

int [] fun(int n ) Here this function is call by value 

{
    int *p ; Here we declare a pointer variable 

    p = (int*)malloc(n*sizeof(int)); Here pointer variable make contigues array of size n in heap memory using malloc function 

    return (p); here it return the n size array 
}
int main ()
{
    int *A ; 
    A=fun(5);
}
