=> Graph (G): A collection of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections). Represented as G=(V,E)
where:

    V is the set of vertices.
    E is the set of edges.

Vertex (Node): A fundamental unit of a graph, represented as a dot or a circle.

Edge: A connection between two vertices. It can be directed or undirected.

Degree of a Vertex: The number of edges connected to a vertex.

    In-degree: Number of incoming edges (only for directed graphs).
    Out-degree: Number of outgoing edges (only for directed graphs).

Self Loop : A edge of a particular vertex pointing it self that is called self loop 


2. Types of Graphs

    Directed Graph (Digraph): A graph where edges have a direction (â†’).

    Undirected Graph: A graph where edges have no direct

    Simple Digraph : A graph has not parallel edges , indegree and outdegree . 

    Strongly connected Graph : From any node of graph we reach every node of graph then 
    the graph is Strongly connected graph .

    Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains at least one cycle.

    Acyclic Graph: A graph without any cycles.

    Tree: A connected acyclic graph.
